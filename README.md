```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-PrimitiveAnything
pip install -r ComfyUI-PrimitiveAnything/requirements.txt
```

pytorch3d is installed automatically on first run via `install.py`.

## Nodes

- **PrimitiveAnything** - Main node for primitive decomposition

## Usage

1. Load a 3D mesh (GLB/OBJ/STL)
2. Connect to PrimitiveAnything node
3. Model downloads automatically from HuggingFace on first run
4. Output: GLB with colored primitives (15 HLS colors)
